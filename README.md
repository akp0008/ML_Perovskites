End-to-end Materials Informatics framework for the high-throughput analysis of **1,044 halide perovskites** utilizing **CHGNet-derived defect formation energies (DFEs)**. Integrates **unsupervised clustering (BGMM)**, **explainable machine learning (CatBoost + SHAP)**, and **inferential statistics (ANOVA + Tukey HSD)** to navigate complex stability-bandgap trade-offs. The modular architecture is designed to accelerate tandem solar cell discovery (1.5 eV target) via agentic hyperparameter optimization.

## Modular ML Pipeline

**Location:** `src/`

The core predictive logic is implemented as a **Modular Machine Learning Pipeline** designed for high-throughput materials discovery and autonomous property optimization. The architecture emphasizes scalability, interpretability, and automated diagnostics.

### Core Features

- **Agentic Tuning**
  - Integrated **Optuna** engine for automated hyperparameter optimization.
  - Enables efficient exploration of model configurations with minimal manual intervention.

- **Explainability (XAI)**
  - Built-in **SHAP** and **feature importance** modules.
  - Supports extraction and analysis of physically meaningful descriptors.

- **Diagnostics & Monitoring**
  - Automated generation of **learning curves** to assess bias–variance trade-offs.
  - **Parity plots** for evaluating predictive accuracy and systematic errors.

This modular design allows seamless extension to new models, descriptors, and optimization strategies while maintaining reproducibility and transparency.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
Located in: `notebooks/EDA/`
* **Distribution Analysis:** Visualizing the spread of defect energies and bandgaps.
* **Correlation:** Spearman/MI/dCor/MIC heatmaps to identify relation between features.
* **Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering:** Unsupervised learning (t-SNE Dimensionality Reduction + Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model clustering) to group compounds based on physiochemical descriptors.

### 2. Machine Learning Models
Located in: `notebooks/Models/`
Each notebook trains a gradient-boosted decision tree (CatBoost) for a specific target property:
* **Inputs:** Compositional vectors and elemental properties.
* **Targets:** Bandgap ($E_g$) and Defect Formation Energies ($E_A, E_B, E_X$).
* **Workflow:** Preprocessing -> Hyperparameter Tuning (Optuna) -> Validation -> SHAP Analysis.

### 3. Statistical Analysis
Located in: `notebooks/Statistics/`
* **Inferential Statistics:** One-way ANOVA to test the significance of site-specific substitutions.
* **Tukey HSD:** Pairwise comparisons exported to `results/tukey/` to identify distinct stability clusters (e.g., comparing MA-based vs. FA-based stability).

## Dataset

The project relies on:
* **`data/dataset.csv`**: A structured table containing stoichiometry, physiochemical features (radii, density, tolerance factor, etc.), and target variables derived from DFT/CHGNet calculations.


## Installation

To reproduce the environment, it is recommended to use a clean virtual environment (conda or venv).

### Option 1: Using pip
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: Using Conda
```bash
conda create -n material-ml python=3.10
conda activate material-ml
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

1. **Launch Jupyter Lab:**
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
2. **Navigate** to the `notebooks/` directory to run the specific analysis.
3. **Note on Paths:** Ensure relative paths in the notebooks point to `../../data/dataset.csv` so the data loads correctly.
